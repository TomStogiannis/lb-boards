Method,Material Costs,Labor Tasks,Power/Ground pins,Wires secure?,Mounting,I2C Support
Processor,UNO - $30,Strip wires and solder to parts,3 GND1 PWR,Wires don't stay in holes with any stress.,Poor,No connector
Breadboards,Uno - $30 +Breadboard $10,Strip wires or use breadboard wires,120 each PWR/GND for 700 point breadboard,Moderately secure since the holes are usually “tight”,Poor,No connector
ProtoShields,Uno - $30 +Shields - $15,Lot of time- consuming soldering of custom wiring,Vary but usually enough although maybe not connectorized in the best use,Wires typically soldered so secure,Poor,No connector
Sensor Shields,Uno - $30 +Shields - $15,Use custom wires,Excellent at 1 per Arduino Digital/Analog pin,Connectors are secure,Poor,Yes
Screw Wings,Uno - $30 + Wing Shield - $15,Strip wires and solder to parts,Varies depending upon shield,Connections very secure,Poor,No connector
Screwduino,$30 (est),Strip wires and solder to parts,5 – Ground 4 – PowerAdditional on other connectors,Connections very secure,Excellent,Yes
