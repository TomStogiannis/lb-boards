[Board Top]


    Board Top

This is an render of what we think your board will look like after
fabrication as viewed from the top.

[Board Bottom]


    Board Bottom

This is an render of what we think your board will look like after
fabrication as viewed from the bottom.

[Bottom Layer]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-Back.gbl"


    Bottom Layer

  * This is the bottom copper layer of your board.

[Top Layer]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-Front.gtl"


    Top Layer

  * This is the top layer of copper on your PCB.

[Bottom Solder Mask]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-Mask_Back.gbs"


    Bottom Solder Mask

  * Soldermask layers are "negative" layers. This layer really
    designates where there /shouldn't/ be solder mask. If you draw on
    the soldermask layer ("tStop" and "bStop" in Eagle), those areas
    won't have soldermask.
  * If you don't provide a soldermask layer here, this entire side of
    the board will be coated in soldermask. You probably don't want this.

[Top Solder Mask]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-Mask_Front.gts"


    Top Solder Mask

  * Soldermask layers are "negative" layers. This layer really
    designates where there /shouldn't/ be solder mask. If you draw on
    the soldermask layer ("tStop" and "bStop" in Eagle), those areas
    won't have soldermask.
  * If you don't provide a soldermask layer here, this entire side of
    the board will be coated in soldermask. You probably don't want this.

[Board Outline]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-PCB_Edges.gbr"


    Board Outline

  * The board outline needs to go all the way around the edge of the
    board such that it's "water tight" (no gaps).
  * Non-rectangular board shapes are allowed, but you'll be billed for
    the smallest rectangle that would enclose your design. So a circle
    two inches in diameter would be billed at 4 square inches.
  * Cutouts aren't officially supported, but the fab has been doing them
    pretty regularly as long as they're drawn on the board outline
    layer, and are at least 100 mils wide.
  * To try making a cutout, draw the outline of the cutout on the board
    outline layer, or draw the path you'd like the milling tool to make
    using a 0.1" wide line. Cutouts won't be plated.

[Bottom Silk Screen]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-SilkS_Back.gbo"


    Bottom Silk Screen

  * The silkscreen is put on with what is basically a 200 dpi printer.
    Lines thinner than 5 mils will be fattened to 5 mils before printing.
  * Try to keep your silkscreen inside the board outline. It's okay if
    it goes out of the board outline, but it will be trimmed with
    sometimes unpredictable results.
  * The fab will automatically remove any silkscreen that crosses
    drilled holes or exposed metal.

[Top Silk Screen]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4-SilkS_Front.gto"


    Top Silk Screen

  * The silkscreen is put on with what is basically a 200 dpi printer.
    Lines thinner than 5 mils will be fattened to 5 mils before printing.
  * Try to keep your silkscreen inside the board outline. It's okay if
    it goes out of the board outline, but it will be trimmed with
    sometimes unpredictable results.
  * The fab will automatically remove any silkscreen that crosses
    drilled holes or exposed metal.

[Drills]

Rendered from "GVS-32U4.drl"


    Drills

  * Your drill file needs to be in text "NC Drills" or "Excellon"
    format, generated with "2:4" precision, and with "no zero suppression".
  * Make sure the center of your drill hits are all inside the board
    outline. Anything outside of the board outline is automatically removed.
  * Overlapping drill hits aren't allowed.
  * Minimum drill size is 13 mils. Maximum is 360 mils.
  * Plated slots aren't supported.
