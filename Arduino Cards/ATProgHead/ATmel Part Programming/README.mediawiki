== land-boards Atmel Part Programming Files ==

* These are our Atmel related programming files.
** These files were created to program Atmel parts using 
[http://land-boards.com/wiki/index.php?title=ATProgHead ATProgHead] and 
[http://land-boards.com/wiki/index.php?title=GVSDuino GVSDuino] boards,
or []
.

=== Ownership ===

* Some of these files (particularly libraries) were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
