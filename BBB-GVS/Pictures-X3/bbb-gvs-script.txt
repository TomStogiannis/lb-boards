The BBB GVS Cape
has connections to three UARTs
One of the UARTs is 3.3V
The other two UARTs are 5V

To demonstrate the single 3.3V UART we loop back the UART to itself
by connecting the transmit and receive lines
We then run a terminal program on the BBB type into the terminal 
and see the data come back

To demonstrate the two 5V UARTs we cross connect the two UARTs 
by connecting the transmit and receive lines of one UART to the corresponding
receive and transmit lines of the other UART
We run two separate terminal programs on the BBB, 
type on one terminal and and see the data come back on the other terminal.
