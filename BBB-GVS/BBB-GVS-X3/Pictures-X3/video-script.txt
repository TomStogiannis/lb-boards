this is the land-boards GVS board
for the Beaglebone Black

What you are seeing is connections to 12 GPIO lines

Five of the GPIO lines are 5V and
Seven of the GPIO lines are 3.3V

Each of the GPIO lines is being
individually set to outputs

One channel is being set high at a time and
this results in one of the LEDs being ON at a time

Also there are some typical GVS sensors on the breadboard such as 
a GVS pushbutton switch
Buzzer
RGB LED
5 way switch
a couple of IR sensor
