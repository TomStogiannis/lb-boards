Doug's FixKiMods
----------------

- Program parses a KiCad module (PCB footprint) file for errors.
- Program compares the index table at the start to the modules later.
- If the two tables match, the Modules list is printed.
- If they don't match, an error message is printed and the differences between the modules and index lists are printed.
- If a -s command is passed to the program, any modules with spaces will be removed.
