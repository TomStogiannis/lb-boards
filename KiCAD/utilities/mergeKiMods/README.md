Doug's mergeKiMods
------------------

- Program merges two KiCad module files (PCB footprints) into a single file.
- Program compares the index tables of the two files and looks for duplicates.
- For duplicated parts, if the part is the same then the program can merge.
- If the duplicated parts are different an error message is printed and the program ends.
- All parts are checked.
